    "### Usage Notes\n",
    "The training process outputs a bunch of runtime warnings depending on your system. Just ignore them, the code should work despite them.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using jupyter lab, you can right click -> enable scrolling for outputs this makes working with training cells much more user friendly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### No Data Error: \n",
    "Make sure you downloaded the required datasets and place them in the same directory as this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Design a run:\n",
    "- Choose a method from methods\n",
    "- Choose a loss function 'ce' or 'ncce'\n",
    "- Choose a dataset from 'a9a', 'covtype', 'ijcnn1', 'mnist'\n",
    "- The rest of the parameters should be self-explanitory\n",
    "- update the parameters of perform_train_run(dataset, loss, method, epochs=n)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Evaluation:\n",
    "Note that the test accuracy is outputed at the end of the training run, so you might need to scroll down to the end of the output to see it."
